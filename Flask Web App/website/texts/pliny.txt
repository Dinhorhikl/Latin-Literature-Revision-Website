Because I trust, sir, that it is of interest to you, I report that I have sailed with all my staff to Ephesus, around Cape Malia, although I was held back by opposing winds. Now, I intend to head for my province partly in coastal boats, partly in carriages. For while the intense heat hinders my land journey, so too the northerly winds hinder my sailing. 
My dearest Pliny, you have done well to report. For it is of interest to me by what means you reach your province. Moreover, you have decided sensibly sometimes to use boats, sometimes to use carriages, as the places dictate. 
Although I experienced a very healthy/successful sailing as far as Ephesus, sir, indeed from there, after I began to travel in carriages, I was troubles by very serious heat and even little fevers and I stopped at Pergamum. When I crossed over to little coastal boats, I was again held up by opposing winds and reached Bithynia somewhat later than I had hoped, that is to say the 17th September. I cannot however complain about the delay since it fell to me to celebrate your birthday in the province, which was very auspicious.  
Now I am shaking loose the expenses, revenues, and debts of the state of the Prusians. From this very procedure I am learning more and more how necessary it is. For much money is being kept back for different reasons by private individuals. In addition, some is paid out to not at all legitimate payments. This, sir, I write to you at the very commencement of my governorship.
